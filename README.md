# First-Semester-Projects (1st Year)
A collection of the python projects that I coded in my first semester of university.

Assignment 1:
- 
I was required to print hello world

Assignment 2:
- 
I was required to create programs to do the following:
  * Calculate the area of the circle given the radius
  * Guess a secret random number by the computer
  * Calculate the the third side of a triangle given the other 2 sides
  * Convert a time in minutes to hours and days

Assignment 3:
- 
To learn conditional operators I created programs that:
  * A program to validate if numbers entered are corordinates or not
  * Determined if a number was outside of a specific range
  * Determine an animal based on a series of questions
  * A program to print out every 7th number after a user's input

Assignment 4:
- 
To learn String handling, I created programs that:
  * A program that calculates change based on a vending machine
  * A program that simulates an old bulletin board
  * A program that prints out a month based on the starting day and the month


Assignment 5:
- 
To learn how to handle loops, I created programs that:
  * Format data into a bibliography reference
  * Print out a mathematical function given a formula
  * Converting a time from a compact form into a long form


Assignment 6:
- 
To learn how to program functions, I created the following programs that:
  * To create a program that will print out a box of asterisks
  * To calcluate the number of k-permutations of n items
  * An upgraded version of a previous program in which a caldendar month would be printed given the year and the month

Assignment 7:
- 
I created programs and testing modules: 
  * A program that converts english to pig latin
  * A program that would perform calculations with base 5 number system

Assignment 8:
- 
To learn how to use dictionaries and arrays, I created the following programs that: 
  * Create a histogram
  * Emulate the game 2048

Assignment 9:
- 
To learn how to use recursion, I created the following programs that: 
  * Determines if a given pattern matches a given word
  * Determines if an inputted string is a palindrome using recursion
  * Determines if a prime number from a range of numbers is a palindrome
  * Counts the number of pairs of consecutive characters in a string
  * Determines if a given pattern matches a given word including * wildcard characters

Assignment 10:
- 
To learn how to manipulate and read text files, I created the following programs that: 
  * Takes in a length of words and to write all anagrams of that length into a text file
  * Determines if a given word is an anagram of any words found in a feeded textfile 
  * Assists in the debugging of other programs


A collection of prac tests and my solutions to them are also included.
